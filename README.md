# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
I used this ecommerce data to do some descriptive statistics.
building this database was for the purpose of learning postgresql

## Process
Starting with a QA process i determined the quality of my data and where to start on cleaning.
I cleaned using sql commands as documented in the cleaning_data.md file. I believe i did a good job of
cleaning the data. I did not do calulations on the data to verify its correctness so some
issues may arise.

## Results
The result is cleaned tables all ready to join by primary keys. Some foreign keys exist
but are not noted in the ERD, they can be located though by inspection. one is product.sku is equal to the column 
analytics.fullvisitorid to complete the tables.

## Challenges 
The only problem i ran into was i accidentally lost some data. i didnt seem to have any issues while
doing my calculations so im hoping thats okay.

## Future Goals
Complete all cleaning and work on markdown structure.
