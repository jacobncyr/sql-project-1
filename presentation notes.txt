Project Flow Structure:

Data Exploration:

Gain an understanding of the available tables and their domains.
Identify key variables and relationships within the data.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Clean the data by addressing duplicate records, missing values, and formatting inconsistencies.
Perform necessary data transformations to prepare it for analysis.
Data Analysis and Insights:

Average time on site for visitors who made a purchase:

Plot a graph to visualize the relationship between time on site and purchase behavior.
Visitors with the highest total transaction revenue:

Identify top visitors with the highest revenue and present their details.
Number of unique visitors:

Calculate the total number of unique visitors.
Total number of sessions for each country (top 5):

Generate a graph to showcase the top 5 countries with the highest session count, including Canada.
Total revenue generated per day by visitor within a specific date range:

Analyze revenue generated by each visitor on a daily basis within a specified date range.
Quality Assurance (QA) Process:

Duplicate Records:

Identify and address duplicate records using SQL queries.
Missing Values:

Detect missing values by checking for NULL or empty values in relevant columns.
Badly Formatted Values and Incorrect Data Formats:

Ensure consistency and correctness of data formats.
Calculation Verification:

Perform calculations to verify the accuracy of derived metrics and calculations.
Random Sampling:

Inspect a subset of data through random sampling for quality assurance.
If more time was available:

Conduct further analysis on the relationship between revenue and other variables.
Explore additional metrics and dimensions to gain deeper insights.
Perform statistical tests to validate hypotheses and identify significant patterns.
By following these steps and ensuring data quality through the QA process, valuable insights were obtained, providing a better understanding of visitor behavior, revenue generation, and country-wise session distribution.
